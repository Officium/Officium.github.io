Yanhua's current research focuses on large-scale machine learning for recommender systems. He has published papers in top-tier conference proceedings, including KDD, ICLR, and SIGIR, with a total of 1,000+ [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VS4vZJkAAAAJ&hl=en) citations. 

Previously, Yanhua led the base model team at [Xiaohongshu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/en), working on generative and multimodal recommendation. Before that, he spent two years at Baidu on Feed recommendation and four years at East China Normal University earning his Bachelor's degree in the Department of Mathematics.
